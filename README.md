## Description

Flame Runner is a calming version of the classic 2D endless runner platformer. After coming across the background, “Glacial Mountains: Parallax Background by Vnitti,” and the charming “Blue Flame Character by Pedrofmra,” these were the two main assets that had set the mood, theme, and colour palette for the rest of the game.
